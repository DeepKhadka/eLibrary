How to start developing:

1. Make sure the following is installed on your computer: Yarn, NodeJS, Expo-CLI
2. Install the Expo app on your phone.
3. Run "yarn" after pulling the latest code to install any packages that have not been installed. (This is required on the first run).
4. Run "yarn start" to run the expo development server, and you can select "local" if you can use the simulator on your computer, or "LAN" for using the expo app on your phone (on the same wifi as your computer), or "tunnel" to load it on the expo app from anywhere, using the QR Code or link.
